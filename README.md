# Synergistic Multi-Modal Fusion for Identity-Preserving Face Aging via Latent Diffusion (MDFA)

Official Implementation of the Paper submitted to The Visual Computer.

This project implements MDFA, a structural control adapter for Stable Diffusion v1.5.

Traditional face aging often struggles with the trade-off between identity fidelity and realistic geometric transformation. Our framework addresses this by:

Multi-Level Cross-Attention (MLCA): Harmonizing dense identity features with sparse geometric priors (landmark heatmaps).

Latent Adapter (LA): Hierarchically injecting fused guidance into the frozen U-Net backbone.
